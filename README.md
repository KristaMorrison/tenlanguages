# tenlanguages

This is my first project using bootstrap, completed as part of my education at LEARN Academy.  It was a pair programming project with Vincent Nguyen.  


The challenge was outlined as follows:

Top 10 Web Languages Website with Bootstrap
Create a website of your Top 10 Web Languages.

This is a challenge in the use of Bootstrap.
As usual, design the page however you like but use the Bootstrap 1 | 2 | 3 column layout
Spend minimal time on what images you want on the page and more time using Bootstrap to get the website to look how you want.
Some Bootstrap to include should be a jumbotron, some buttons and a navigation bar.


Note that the "more info" tabs on each of the ten sections goes to the Wikipedia page for that language.  However, clicking on "More Info" for the Ruby section takes you to another page we created as part of our project.  This was one of my first multi-page projects.

All content for the challenge came from Wikipedia.
